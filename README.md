Networks project investigating the BA model

In this project, the Barabasi-Albert model is solved analytically for preferential, random and
mixed preferential/random attachment probabilities to find the degree distributions
and variation of expected largest degree with network size. It is found that both the
preferential and mixed attachment cases lead to power-law degree distributions and
that random attachment leads to a exponential degree distribution. The theoretical
results are then compared to numerical simulations, revealing finite size effects in
the tail of the distribution. The numerical and theoretical distributions show good
agreement through the Kolgomorov-Smirnov test up to a finite size effect cut off
point. The numerical largest degree converges to the theoretical value for large
system sizes, and it is found that this occurs more quickly for the random and
mixed attachment cases.
